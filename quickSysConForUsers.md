# Quick Systemic Consensus - for users
## Voicing a proposal
If you have a proposal that you'd like the group to adopt, clearly state it beginning with "I propose ..." - this signifies you have a complete idea that you support. (If you're just looking for opinions, ask something like "What do you think about ...?")

## Expressing resistance
If someone has made a proposal, you will be asked to express any personal resistance towards it. This is done by silently raising one hand - you do not need to have a logical reason or an alternative proposal in order to express resistance.

### No resistance
If no one raises a hand, the proposal becomes the group decision.

###Resistance â†’ Quick SysCon
If one or more hands are raised, Quick SysCon begins. The original proposal will first be written down, then the topic will be summarized from that proposal and two control options will be added:

* Passive solution: the decision to keep things as they are. This solution is often "It's not clear".
* Deepen process: the decision will be continued outside the meeting using a deeper process - Online systemic consensus unless specified otherwise.

Next you will be asked if you have any further proposals to add. If you do, clearly state them. At this point, please limit dialogue to amending or removing your proposal(s), asking others to clarify their proposals, responding to requests for clarification on your proposal(s), providing information or stating a personal opinion - in particular, do not discuss proposals.

Once all proposals have been collected you will be asked to rate the proposals based on how much you resist them. Each proposal will be read out in turn and you will be asked to rate after each - this is done silently using your hands:

* No resistance (0) - keep both hands in your lap (I love it, like it or have no problem with it)
* Some resistance (1) - raise one hand clearly, keep your other in your lap. (I have some problem(s) with it)
* High resistance (2) - raise both hands clearly. (I really do not want this option)

The option with least cumulative resistance (based on the numerical values) becomes the group decision. If there is a tie, the tied options will be read out and rated again based on enthusiasm (raised hands meaning 'I like it!')
Back to the meeting

Someone will announce the decision that has been made then the meeting will continue where it left off.

## Tips
* Make use of the more informal meeting dialogue to get the information you need to create a good proposal before you voice it: Once voiced, the formal process will begin and continue until completion.
* The clear expression of a proposal is as important as the proposal content - if people don't understand, they will be resistant.
