# Autonomy

Great! Hang on...
For a region, autonomy means self-governance independent of a larger, former region it was part of. But if this new autonomous region still opresses its own sub-regions, other regions or incodividuals, the meaning of 'autonomy' is misleading. Let's call this regional autonomy.
For a person, autonomy means self-governance independent of another person or froup. But if this person opresses a group or other individuals, the use of autonomy is misleading. Let's call this personal autonomy.
To describe autonomy in a way consistent with the state of consent, let's use the word omniautonomy: individuals, groups and regions respect the autonomy of eachother. Between individuals omniautonomy means allowing each to pursue their own will. If their will is coordinated, they can cooperation as a group.
