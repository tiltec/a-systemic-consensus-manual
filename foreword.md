# Preface 

## Genesis
	
Many excellent things have been done and can only be done when people manage to constructively work together. Like building pyramids, making smart-phones, throwing festivals or eradicating nasty diseases. However many of these excellent things were/are done in a way not so excellent for all the people involved, often fundamentally - or directly - involving force whether physical, economic or social. Not so good. 

Can people - people like you - arrange themselves to do the things we want with less wasted energy, time and resources and more equality, autonomy and joy? Yes! You better believe it. Loads of groups are finding their way towards this goal as we speak. In order to work together (collaborate), groups without force must develop find agreeable plans (coordinate). A universal concept in coordination is the Decision. What are gorup decisions? What methods lead to the best results? Can I start now?

## Purpose
	
The purpose of this text is to help people make great group decisions; by examining the very meaning of 'group decisions', theory regarding groups and conflict, existing techniques, the Systemic Consensus framework, the design of complete decision making systems and some wild predictions about the future.

All attempts have been made to write as pluralistically as possible, that is, without moralising that there is The One Right Way. This hopefully allows you, dear reader, to make your own decisions. As such philosophical elements are phrased more like questions, theoretical elements are offered as perspectives, practical elements are written neutrally and opion pieces are made explicit.
	
## Limitations
	
This text will not solve your problems and wake you up with a cup of tea in the morning! Unforunately you still have to do that, sorry. Hopefully you'll get some nice ideas to play with though. Also, this text currently has one writer thus everything is filtered through the singular perspective of a young, white-ish, European, male scientist (who is also not a lawyer).
	
## Scope

Decision making affects every individual and groups of every size, so there is hopefully something for everyone in this text. That said, it is definitely geared towards groups of a more voluntary nature with an subconscious bias towards scalability.

# What is a preface?

"A preface or foreword deals with the **genesis, purpose, limitations, and scope of the book and may include acknowledgments of indebtedness;** an introduction deals with the subject of the book, supplementing and introducing the text and indicating a point of view to be adopted by the reader. The introduction usually forms a part of the text [and the text numbering system]; the preface does not."

# Cut lines

On a fundamental level group issues are seldom to do with What, When and Where, but far more often with How and Why.

This text focusses primarily on How. More specifically, how groups make decisions. Decision making is only one aspect of how people can work together, but it is universal and crucial.

How could it be that these groups where people chose to be together and had huge amounts of common ground could find it so hard to cooperate?

However, most of these groups were not building pyramids, making smart-phones or erdicating nasty diseases (festivals, yes.)

The groups of a more voluntary nature tended to create environments with more equality, autonomy and joy but were often inefficient or sometimes completely ineffective at finding a common path to achieving their stated goals. The groups of a less voluntary nature tended to achieve more of their stated goals with the use of force and at personal cost to the individuals within them.
