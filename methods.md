# Methods

This section runs through a whole lot of different decision making systems in the categories of Chance, Autonomy, Autonomy, Majority, Consent and Consensus

| People involved in the decision | Fairness | Potential intelligence | Complexity |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| None (chance) | Total | None | None |
| Some of group | Some | Some | Some |
| Whole group | **Most** | **Most** | **Most** |

There are a number of familiar methods groups can come to decisions. Changing to new methods always takes time and energy. You may have noticed some problems with decision making in the world, but believe that there are no real alternatives to change to. This phenomenon is nicely summarized in the Declaration of Independence (proto-USA):

>"... mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed." 

Whilst acknowledging that living with a bad system is not unusual, it goes on to say:

>But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security"

The Declaration of Independence is talking about the King of England ruling from afar being so problematic they up a republic. This manual talks about the current *methods* of decision making - at international, national, local and community levels - being so problematic that we should use Systemic Consensus.

Three broad categories

## No one decides for the group ##

With no person deciding, we bring in chance. This is useful in games and competitions where it's useful to break equality between players. This could be a dice roll or the shuffling and dealing of cards. Chance is also employed when it things seem too complicated to decide upon - what if one item is to be gifted to 100 people, who should get it? For studies, chance is important to remove researcher bias: applicants may be sorted into two groups at random. With chance it's important to consider how random the chance is.

Chance is typically a bad way to make intelligent or focused decisions. People are not likely to follow through if the result doesn't suit.

* Chance
  * Pseudo Random
  * Mostly Random
    * Drawing straws
    * Coin Flip
  * Truly Random
    * Quantum no. generation
  
## Some decide for the group ##

This group is broadly split into two categories - authority and autonomy. In authority, there is an imbalance of power between individuals. Decisions are made by those with more power and cascaded down to those with less. There is typically some kind of enforcement to ensure compliance. In autonomy, individuals are equally powerful - the only authority being the decision of a group that they consent to be part of. Decisions are made by any individual without the use of force.

  * Authority
    * Monarchy/Autarchy
    * Oligarchy/Aristocracy
    * Elected representatives
    * Meritocracy
    * Informal (!!)
  * Autonomy
    * Doocracy
    * I-will-do-it-ocracy
    * Advice Process
    * 3 pirate rule
    
## Whole group decides for group ##

This group is tenuously split into three: Majority, Consent and Consensus. Majority attempts to find the option desired by most. First-past-the-post voting comes to mind first for most people but *this is not the only type!* Consent attempts to find the option that is accepted by everyone and desired by most. Consensus attempts to find the option accepted by most and desired by most. 

  * Majority (voting?)
    * Majority
      * Plurality (Relative majority, First-past-the-post, > 0 %)
      * Majority (Absolute majority, > 50 %)
      * Supermajority (Qualified majority, >> 50 %)
    * Cumulative
    * Ranking
      * Borda count
      * Single Transferrable Vote
      * Instant Run-off Vote
      * Schulze
      * Ranked Choice Voting
    * Approval
    * Rating (Score voting, Range voting)
  * Consent 
    * Consent circle
    * Voting with veto/Unanimous consensus
  * Consensus
    * Consensus circle
    * Systemic Consensus
        * Quick Systemic Consensus
        * Base Systemic Consensus
        * Deep Systemic Consensus

## Aboard the Hope of Progress ##

Some months ago at the local tavern there was a chance encounter. Unusually crowded for an autumnal Tuesday night, five strangers found themselves together round a small, circular table and sipped at their ale. Abi speaks her mind,

"Why, what I wouldn't give to be on some sunny shore..."

The others - One-eyed Bill, Oscar, Peggy-leg and Blue-eyes - consider this, nod and start talking... The rest is history. The Hope of Progress has been sailing for some weeks now and whilst an overwhelmingly great experience for the crew, there have been some niggling issues, namely: **What shall we do with a drunken sailor?**

Several times now it's happened. At some unholy hour (usually early in the morning) someone has had a bit too much to drink and wakes the others up with loud sea-shantying or jig-dancing above the sleeping quarters. Before now decisions had been like magic: the first proposal was equally shared by the whole crew and was instantly adopted. This time however, the proposal made by Abi to "**Barrel-roll:** Put them in a barrel and roll them over" was not shared by everyone. Talking further about the topic brought up even more options:

* **Counseling:** The idea is put forward to assign a crew member to check up on the sailor-in-question on a daily basis for a week.
* **Withdraw rum (week):** The crew currently has a daily allowance of three drafts of rum per day. One suggestion is withdraw this allowance from the guilty party for a week.
* **Withdraw rum (month):** A very similar suggestion to the previous one, except for a longer withdrawal period.
* **Meditation:** Another proposal was for one hour of mindfulness meditation for the whole crew every second Monday.

However, each proposal meets some disagreement. The crew are a bit dismayed with this situation and are not sure how to proceed. They agree that it's worth trying something, but how should they fairly decide what to try first? Thus begins the first social experiment aboard the Hope of Progress as they experiment with different decision making methods. Avast ye!

* Abi: Started the ship and pushed it forwards. A natural leader by character and happy to express how she feels in a charismatic way. Abi is also a bit of a traditionalist: She thinks that the Barrel-roll is not too much suffering for someone happy to inflict suffering on others. The only option she is really resistant to is Meditation: She tried meditating once and found it really boring. 
* One-eyed Bill remembers fondly how a good friend saw him through his dark days 'on the sauce' and how simply having someone to talk to was life-changing for him. He's not really got a strong opinion on any of the options, but does have some concerns about Barrel-roll.
* Oscar is a bit insecure for whatever reason and thinks that Counseling and Meditation are 'soft options' and doesn't support them. He thinks that handing out rum in the first place was a bad idea and that it's an obvious slippery-slope to the problem in question. Oscar is convinced that Withdraw rum (month) is the best option and that Withdraw rum (week) is the next best.
* Peggy-leg does have some preference towards Withdraw rum (week), that this is enough for people to realize the error in their ways and stop. What is more important to Peggy than her preference is group harmony and she really just wants what everyone wants.
* Blue-eyes got blue eyes whilst meditating on mountain retreat - an experience that lead to profound changes. Aside from Meditation, Blue-eyes believes that Counseling is the best option. Not so keen with the denial options, Withdraw rum (week/month), the only option E really dislikes is Barrel-roll which E believes is violent.
