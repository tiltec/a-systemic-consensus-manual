## Preface 

### Genesis
	worked with voluntary groups, puzzled why we can't work together better, decisions a core element
	
For some years now my mind keeps returning to the subject of how people organize. So many excellent things have been done and can only be done when people manage to constructively work together, like building pyramids, making smart-phones, throwing festivals or eradicating nasty diseases. However many of these excellent things were/are not so excellent for all the people involved. The question that subsequently keeps me up at night is: How can people like you and I arrange ourselves to do the things we want with less wasted energy, time and resources and more equality, autonomy and joy? 

I've been lucky to participate in a lot of different groups: the first child in a nuclear family of 5, a citizen of Scotland/The United Kingdom/The European Union, a pupil in a state school, the head boy of a high school, a member at a church AGM, a student at a university, a user of a buyer cooperative, a volunteer at a worker cooperative, an employee of a corporation, a researcher in a PhD team, a voter in a national referendum, a camper at a protest village, a resident of an occupied building, a journeyman in a tribe of nomads...

The groups of a more voluntary nature tended to create environments with more equality, autonomy and joy[^*] but were often inefficient or sometimes completely ineffective at finding a common path to achieving their stated goals. The groups of a less voluntary nature tended to achieve more of their stated goals with the use of force and at personal cost to the individuals within them. In my experience the barriers to performance within the more voluntary groups on a fundamental level were very seldom to do with What, When and Where, but far more often with How and Why.

This text focusses primarily on How. More specifically, how groups make decisions. Decision making is only one aspect of how people can work together, but it is universal and crucial.

### Purpose
	
The purpose of this text is to help people make great group decisions. This goal is pursued by examining the very meaning of 'group decisions', some theory regarding groups and conflict, a curated list of existing techniques, the introduction of Systemic Consensus, the design of complete decision making systems and some wild predictions about the future.

All attempts have been made to write as pluralistically as possible, without moralising that there is The One Right Way. This hopefully allows you, dear reader, to make your own decisions. As such philosophical elements are phrased more like questions, theoretical elements are offered as perspectives, practical elements are written neutrally and opion pieces are made explicit.
	
### Limitations
	
I am not a lawyer... I am a Chemist and have a sciency/systemsy perspective of life, further, everything is filtered through that sciency/systemsy perspective of life as I am currently the sole author.
	
### Scope

Decision making affects everyone and groups of every size, so there is hopefully something for everyone in this text. That said, it is definitely geared towards groups of a more voluntary nature.

A preface or foreword deals with the ***genesis, purpose, limitations, and scope of the book and may include acknowledgments of indebtedness;*** an introduction deals with the subject of the book, supplementing and introducing the text and indicating a point of view to be adopted by the reader. The introduction usually forms a part of the text [and the text numbering system]; the preface does not.

How could it be that these groups where people chose to be together and had huge amounts of common ground could find it so hard to cooperate? However, most of these groups were not building pyramids, making smart-phones or erdicating nasty diseases (festivals, yes.)
