A preface or foreword deals with the genesis, purpose, limitations, and scope of the book and may include acknowledgments of indebtedness; an introduction deals with the subject of the book, supplementing and introducing the text and indicating a point of view to be adopted by the reader. The introduction usually forms a part of the text [and the text numbering system]; the preface does not.

For some time now my attention has been on how people can work better together. With less waste of energy, time and other resources and more joy. Having been involved in a number of voluntary groups over the past years, I was amazed to see how often they were inefficient and sometimes completely ineffective at finding a common path and achieving their stated goals. How could it be that these groups where people chose to be together and had huge amounts of common ground could find it so hard to cooperate? In my experience problems were very seldom to do with What, When and Where on a fundamental level, but far more often with How and Why. This text focusses primarily on How. More specifically, how groups can make decisions. Decision making is only one aspect of how people can work together, but it is universal and crucial.
