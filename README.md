# About

This text explores group decisions. What are they (good for)? How can you arrive at them? More well known methods are reviewed ahead of the introduction of a simple, scalable and consent-oriented decision making framework called **Systemic Consensus** which combines range voting with control options and consensus logic. The aspects required for understanding and implementation thereof will be covered.

## Working together

Yes please! I really want to create a living, accessible and curated piece of work which draws on many perspectives and experiences so that we can create one/few excellent books instead of hundreds of mediocre ones. Contact me [@DougInAMug](https://twitter.com/DougInAMug) if interested to collaborate or simply fork (See 'License') if you can't wait/want to go solo.

## License 

Take it, use it - don't ask. (See 'Working together')
