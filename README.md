# About

This text explores group decisions. What are they (good for)? How can you arrive at them? More well known methods are reviewed ahead of the introduction of a simple, scalable and consent-oriented decision making framework called **Systemic Consensus** which combines range voting with control options and consensus logic. The aspects required for understanding and implementation thereof will be covered. 

## Version

Not yet. This text is in _active development_ as of 2016-09-xx and probably makes horrible reading, though you're welcome to look in as words come together. Export to .pdf, .mobi and .epub has currently been disabled for faster compile times, but can be easily re-enabled if desired. Hurl any abuse/flattery/suggestions towards [@DougInAMug](https://twitter.com/DougInAMug). Cheers, D.

## Working together

Yes please! I really want to create a living, accessible and curated piece of work which draws on many perspectives and experiences so that we can create one/few excellent books instead of hundreds of mediocre ones. Contact me [@DougInAMug](https://twitter.com/DougInAMug) if interested to collaborate or simply fork if you can't wait/want to go solo.
