## Working together

Yes please! I really want to create a living, accessible and curated piece of work which draws on many perspectives and experiences so that we can create one/few excellent books instead of hundreds of mediocre ones. Contact me [@DougInAMug](https://twitter.com/DougInAMug) if interested to collaborate or simply fork if you can't wait/want to go solo.
