# Introduction

<!--
A preface or foreword deals with the genesis, purpose, limitations, and scope of the book and may include acknowledgments of indebtedness; an introduction deals with the subject of the book, supplementing and introducing the text and indicating a point of view to be adopted by the reader. The introduction usually forms a part of the text [and the text numbering system]; the preface does not.

## On words

Before we fall down the rabbit-hole, let's look at some words.

What is a decision? A decision is a commitment to action, a promise of change. A decision can be made with full consciousness or completely subconsciously, it can have a vast scope or a minute one. The success of a decision is dependent on its implementation, its manifestion in reality. Implementing a decision means performing action consistent to achieving the desired change, doing it. The goodness of a decision is a subjective measure, relative to the intended outcome. 

What is a group? A group is an association of two or more individuals and the subsequent non-physical entity created. A group is created and sustained by individuals identifying themselves as part of it. A group can be planned or emergent, as small as two or as big as you can imagine. One can consider a group to be an imaginary person with attributes similar to those of a human, distinct from the composite individuals. 

What is a group decision? A group decision is decision by a group. How can the non-physical group, without body or voice, express itself? Only through the expression of the group members and the aggregation of those expressions. The commitment of a group to action is thus a commitment of the members to action and the success of the decision thus rests upon the members.

## On rationalism

Why do you do anything? If the success of a group decision is dependent on the members making that decision personally, this question is important. The answer is usually logical on the surface, but is fundamentally emotional. Pursue someone about why they do something far enough and the answer at a base level is very often,

> "Because I *feel* like it"

The importance of emotions is often dismissed by rationalism, SysCon embraces both. Emotions and feelings are really important! Farewell Rational Robotic Agent, hello Squishy Subjective Animal. Literally thousands of studies show that people who feel connected act more cooperatively.[^CITE]

Emotional and logical are part of a continuum, where the framework
If the ultimate reason for doing is feeling, then feelings are a significant factor in doing.
Feelings are based on experiences consciously or subconsciously and may not seem rational in the present.
It follows that feelings and their origins should be considered before strategies are developed, that why should be considered before how, what, how, when, where or who.

## A model

A simple model for any decision making system is shown below

* **Feelings.** The natural, honest and internal feelings towards the options.
* **Filter.** The filter through which feelings must pass. (the permitted expression)
* **Individual expression.** The transmitted expression. (cardinal or ordinal values)
* **Aggregation.** Aggregation process.
* **Group expression.**
* **Logic.** Decision rules. 
* **Result.**

## Our bias

Authority, represnetative democracy, FPTP voting (UK/US), physical force, forceful keeping together.

Voting for representatives to govern your country is really different to deciding something that you will do for several reasons. Firstly, you vote for an ideology not an action. This is really significant. The second is that in voting for representatives you basically delegate your responsibility and authority.

Indeed groups can form without any of the members ever meeting in person thanks to l'internetz and such. The concept of groups is strongly supported within the legal system of most countries, where the incorporation of a group gives birth to a distinct legal entity

A group is collective fiction between the members, a non-physical entity with properties separate to any one of the individuals. 

will only be successful if the respective individuals personally commit to the group decision or at least do not stand against it. The way in which a group decision is made can have a significant impact on what is decided.
